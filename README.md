# Karaite Messianic Lunar Calendar

This is a web-based calendar built to calculate the biblical feast days (Moedim) based on Karaite principles (visual new moon sighting and Aviv barley).

This app was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Astronomical Predictions:** Uses **SunCalc.js** to predict the astronomical new moon as a baseline.
* **Manual Confirmation:** Allows the user to manually input the confirmed "Day 1" of each month after a visual sighting.
* **Feast Day Calculator:** Automatically calculates all feast days (Passover, Shavuot, Yom Teruah, etc.) based on the user's confirmed dates.
* **3D Moon Visualizer:** Uses **Three.js** to render a photorealistic 3D model of the moon, lit in real-time to show the correct phase.
* **Accurate Star Map:** Loads a real star catalog to display thousands of stars and constellation lines in the 3D background.
* **Zodiac Position:** Calculates and displays the sun's current position in the zodiac.
* **Local Storage:** Saves your confirmed dates in the browser so you don't lose them on refresh.
